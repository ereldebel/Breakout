# Breakout
My first Unity and C# project.
A classic Breakout clone set in space.

All script were written in C# by me.
All sprites were created by me using Microsoft PowerPoint and GIMP.

The game was created in the _Game Development Foundations_ course as part of the _Bezalel Game Development and Design Minor_ of my _Computer Science B.Sc._ in _The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel_.

To run the game on windows run the _Windows Build/Breakout.exe_ executable file.

To run the game on mac run the  _Mac Build.app_ package.

The _Source_ Directory contains all the source material excluding Unity's _TextMeshPro_ assets directory which can be downloaded directly through the _Unity Editor_.
